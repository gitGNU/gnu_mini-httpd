/**
 *  \file  io.hpp
 *  \brief High-level I/O driver interface.
 *
 *  mini-httpd separates all I/O code from the actual HTTP state machine. This
 *  module provides a fairly high-level I/O driver that can run arbitrary
 *  handler functions of type
 *
 *    <pre>  bool (input_buffer &, size_t, output_buffer &)</pre>
 *
 *  as an asynchronous TCP service. I/O is driven by input events and the
 *  driver alternates between a "read" and "write" state until aborted. Every
 *  time new data arrives on the socket, the driver triggers the callback with
 *  the input buffer and passes the number of newly appended bytes as a
 *  parameter. The value 0u signifies that the input stream has ended and is to
 *  be interpreted as a shut-down signal, saying "write all remaining output
 *  now". The handler function can also abort the I/O driver prior to EOF by
 *  returning false. If the handler function returns true, the driver goes into
 *  "write" state until the entire contents of the \c output_buffer has been
 *  written before going back into "read" state.
 *
 *  An \c input_buffer is a continous memory buffer that -- from the handler
 *  function's perspective -- can be interpreted as a window into the input
 *  stream. The handler function can consume data from the front of buffer to
 *  make space for further input. It can also choose not to consume anything
 *  and to defer processing until more input has arrived. In that case, the I/O
 *  driver enlarges the buffer dynamically to allow further reading if
 *  necessary. A handler function that never consumes input until EOF
 *  essentially slurps the entire stream into one continous memory buffer
 *  (which might involve fairly expensive copying).
 *
 *  The \c output_buffer is a scatter I/O vector of continous memory ranges.
 *  Data can be written into this buffer either statically or dynamically. To
 *  write a string "statically" simply means to append it's begin and end
 *  address to the output buffer. Consequently, the existance of the object
 *  that owns this memory must be guaranteed until the time the output buffer
 *  has been written (which is well beyond the handler function's stack frame).
 *  In case of a buffered write, the output buffer takes ownership of the data
 *  being by copying, which is less efficient but very convenient.
 *
 *  As a consequence of the driver's mode of operation, the contents of the \c
 *  input_buffer is always guaranteed to exist for the life-time of a write
 *  state. No input takes place until the write is done, so \c input_buffer
 *  will not change until then. Input data can always be re-used for output
 *  without copying.
 *
 *  In terms of performance, it is in the handler's best interest to consume
 *  the buffer eagerly. To encourage that, an iteration strategy termed \c
 *  stream_driver exists as an adaptor template. A stream driver can run a
 *  handler function of this type:
 *
 *    <pre>  size_t (byte_const_ptr, byte_const_ptr, size_t i, output_buffer &)</pre>
 *
 *  A stream handler can be thought of as a lexer or a tokenizer. As a matter
 *  of fact, its signature is very similar to the one of \c
 *  boost::spirit::parse(). The integer value a stream handler returns
 *  signifies how many bytes it has consumed from the front of the input
 *  window. Returning 0u signifies blocking, and will result in the handler to
 *  be called again when more input has been read.

 *  \todo This is not really the native type. Boost.Asio does have a typedef
 *        for the native io_vector type, but it considers that a private
 *        implementation detail. Which is unfortunate, because without that
 *        type it is not possible to create a native scatter I/O array. Which
 *        means that the scatter array we pass for reading or writing has to
 *        be copied internally before it can be used. This subject needs
