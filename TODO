- Check that htdocs for a host is a readable directory before going on.
  Maybe normalize the htdocs path in configuration() to begin with.

- Make custom version of escape_quotes().

- Add code that will detach the process from the terminal. Also add -D
  switch to disable detaching.

- Allow names of users and groups rather than the numerical id.

- Do not log via syslog.

- Make sure the host name exists before writing anything to the log file.
