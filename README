Description

  mini-httpd is a mini-malistic web server designed for optimal
  performance, high security, and as little use of system
  resources as possible. Unlike most other web servers,
  mini-httpd does not require more than one process or system
  thread in order to handle several requests concurrently.
  Instead, it uses the poll(2) system call to multiplex an
  arbitrary number of connections internally.

  The downside is, of course, that mini-httpd has zero fancy
  features. All it can do is hand out static files from the hard
  disk. There is no support for CGI scripts or any kind of
  dynamic content. If you need a more sophisticated set-up, this
  software is not for you. If you really, really need additional
  features, well, you have the source code.

  In brief, here is an overview of what mini-httpd can do:

   1. HTTP1/1 compliant "keep-connection" support

   2. Virtual hosting

   3. Record successful requests in the common Apache-style
      log-file format

   4. Run in a chroot(2) sandbox

   5. Drop all super-user privileges after acquiring the
      listening socket

  Furthermore, mini-httpd is configured completely through the
  command line, there is no config file. For further details on
  how to set-up the web server, refer to the section "Setting
  mini-httpd up" section below.

Command-line Options

  -h
      Show command line syntax and exit.

  -d, --debug
      Enable additional debugging messages. Debugging is only
      available if mini-httpd has been compiled with the
      --with-debug configure option. Otherwise, the debug messages
      are not included in the binary.

  --version
      Show mini-httpd's version string and exit.

  -p number, --port number
      Tell mini-httpd on which port to listen for incoming
      requests. The default port number is 80.

  -r path, --change-root path
      When started with super-user privileges, mini-httpd will
      chroot(2) to the directory provided with this option. Please
      note that once the process's root directory has been changed,
      all other paths are interpreted relative to the new root
      directory! If you specify -r /usr/local/mini-httpd, for
      example, the document root /usr/local/httpd/htdocs has to be
      given as /htdocs. Keep that in mind when specifying the other
      paths!


      The default chroot-directory is the prefix provided to
      configure when mini-httpd was built. Usually, that is
      /usr/local/mini-httpd.

      If you want to disable chroot()ing altogether, provide the
      empty string: -r "". This is not recommended, however.

  --document-root path
      This option sets the document root directory. When an access
      to, say, http://example.org/index.html comes in, mini-httpd
      will try to access the file example.org/index.html in this
      directory. Note that hostnames must be spelled in all
      lower-case in the file system!

      The default location is /htdocs.

  -l path, --logfile-directory path
      This option sets the directory mini-httpd uses to create the
      access-log files. In this directory, one file per hostname
      will be created. The default location is /logs.

  -s string, --server-string string
      This option sets the version string mini-httpd returns with
      the Server: header in HTTP replies. The default string is
      "mini-httpd" -- no actual version number is revealed. If you
      want to disable the Server: header altogether, specify the
      empty string: -s "".

  -u uid, --uid uid
      This option sets the numeric user id mini-httpd will setuid()
      to when called with super-user privileges. This is necessary
      because mini-httpd must be started as root in order to be
      able to bind() to port 80. But you don't want the server to
      run as root the whole time! A good choice is usually user id
      "2" (daemon). If this option is unset, mini-httpd will
      continue to use the user id is has been started under.

  -g uid, --gid uid
      This option sets the numeric group id mini-httpd will
      setgid() to when called with super-user privileges. (See
      --uid for further details.)

  --default-page filename
      This option sets the filename mini-httpd accesses when a
      request for a directory is received. The default is
      index.html. This means, that a request for
      http://example.org/ will result in the file
      example.org/index.html being returned.

  -D, --no-detach
      This option tells mini-httpd not to detach from the
      controlling terminal, but to run in the foreground. This is
      useful mostly for debugging purposes. The default is to
      detach.

  -H string, --default-hostname string
      This option sets default hostname mini-httpd uses when a
      pre-HTTP/1.1 request comes in, which does not provide the
      Host: header. If the default hostname is empty or this option
      is omitted, mini-httpd will reject such requests.

Setting mini-httpd up

  Setting mini-httpd up is pretty easy, because the program does
  have the least possible set of features. It may look weird at
  first, especially if you know other web servers like Apache,
  but it's really not that difficult. The following instructions
  assume you've installed mini-httpd using the default prefix,
  /usr/local/mini-httpd. Not that it matters much, though,
  because you can set all paths at the command line.

  It's important to understand that mini-httpd changes the
  process's root directory to /usr/local/mini-httpd once it has
  initialized its internals. Thus, all files related to your web
  service must reside within this directory (or below). You
  cannot symlink to some path outside that hierarchy, or some
  thing.

  First of all, choose an user id you'll run mini-httpd under. A
  sensible choice is daemon, but you can as well use nobody or
  any other user id you see fit. Find out which numeric user id
  this user has on your system by calling the id(1) command:

  $ id daemon
  uid=2(daemon) gid=2(daemon) groups=2(daemon),1(bin)

  Now you'll need to create two directories in
  /usr/local/mini-httpd: htdocs and logs. The first directory
  will contain the actual web documents in one subdirectory per
  (virtual) host you want to provide. The second directory will
  contain the access logs written by mini-httpd. Consequently,
  mini-httpd's user must be allowed to read htdocs and to write
  to logs. The following commands will ensure that:

  # mkdir htdocs logs
  # chown daemon.daemon htdocs logs

  Now create a directory in htdocs, which is called like the
  hostname, your web service should be provided under. Make sure
  you use all lower-case characters! If your web server is
  accessed as, say, example.com and www.example.com, do the
  following:

  # mkdir htdocs/example.org
  # ln -s htdocs/example.org htdocs/www.example.org
  # chown daemon.daemon htdocs/example.org htdocs/www.example.org

  If you're unsure what hostname to use for testing purposes,
  localhost is usually a safe bet. :-)

  Copy the HTML documents to the htdocs/example.org directory and
  ensure that mini-httpd has permission to access them! Finally,
  start mini-httpd as root, using the following command line:

  # /usr/local/mini-httpd/bin/httpd --uid 2

  That's it. You may now direct your favorite browser to
  http://example.org/ and see what happens.

  In case you want to try mini-httpd with some port other than
  80, add the --port option to the command line: --port 8080.
  Furthermore, you might want to add the --debug switch to turn
  on the debugging messages in mini-httpd. That is particularly
  helpful in case mini-httpd is not behaving as you're expecting.

  Once you have accessed the web site, you'll find the
  appropriate access-log file in the logs directory; one file per
  virtual host.

  If you want to add more virtual hosts to mini-httpd, just
  create the corresponding directory in htdocs.
