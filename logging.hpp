/**
 *  \file  logging.hpp
 *  \brief Interface to the mini-httpd logging back-ends.
 *
 *  mini-httpd requires two types of logging back-ends: one for writing HTTP
 *  access logs that, these days, have to look like the ones Apache writes, and
 *  one for administrative messages about the daemon itself. John Torjo has
 *  proposed his <a href="http://www.torjo.com/">logging library</a> to
 *  boost.org, but unfortunately couldn't reach consensus to have it accepted.
 *  For the time being, mini-httpd relies on his code for both tasks, because
 *  the library offers a lot of ready-to-go functionality, including support
 *  for rotating log file, message timestamping, etc.
 *
 *  On systems that appear to conform to POSIX.1-2001, the administrative log
 *  stream is written to \c syslog(3). All other systems log these messages
 *  into a file. The administrative log stream is also written to the console
 *  if the daemon hasn't detached.
 *
 *  \todo Move access logging code into this module.
