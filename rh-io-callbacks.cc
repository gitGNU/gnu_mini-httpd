  This callback is invoked every time socket becomes readable. So what
  we do is to read up to 4kb of data into our line buffer and then
  jump into the state handlers. They will process the data and remove
  anything that's been dealt with. If the buffer overflows, it means
  someone sent us a single header line that was longer than the 4kb
  buffer limit -- obviously a jerk, so we reject the request.
